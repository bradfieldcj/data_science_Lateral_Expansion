# data_science_Lateral_Expansion_(Capstone)
Project designed to predict the profitability of Lateral Expansion of Company A into a relevant field

Large publicly traded companies suffer from the law of decreasing revenue where the profit margin of the company lessens over time and tends to stabilize as their product saturates the available market. On a company to company basis, it can be difficult to know why and when to acquire startup companies 

Step 1) Analyze financial documents to assess market saturation, stagnation, and growth.

Step 2) Identify markets embodying practical lateral expansion for target company and perform similar analyses from Step 1 on these companies.

Step 3) Identify new possible competitors within main and lateral markets

Step 4) Predict revenue increase in perspective company acquisition after gaining availability of parent company resources (eg: parent company marketing, management, and distribution chains).
